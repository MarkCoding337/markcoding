		Using the pizza cutter, follow the grooves in the cutting board and cut the pizza into 6 similar sized slices,

		- Cooler: The cooler has a gauge just to the right of its door (Radial Gauge),
		
		- Novelty Freezer: The freezer with the slidey top that is embedded into the cashier counter on the front left side. The gauge is located inside on the back of the freezer towards the right (Radial Gauge),

		- Freezer: The freezer in the deli with the big door. The temperature gauge is located to the right of the door. (Radial Gauge),
		
		- Bait: The Bait Fridge&#8482; is located near the main entrance to the store very close to the indoor ice freezer. The gauge is somewhere in the fridge and looks very much alike to the bar styles temperature gauges found on the Top & Mid of the walkaround cooler.
